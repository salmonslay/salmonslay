Hi! I'm a game developer at [Filimundus](https://www.filimundus.se/en/), creating fun and challenging games for kids. I am proficient in C# (both through .NET environments & Unity) and C++, and I also have quite some experience in areas such as web development (focus backend with Node), SQL and general hardware. I do not use this account at work; all repositories and contributions are personal.
